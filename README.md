# LiveGradient
A website project where you can generate CSS gradients.

Progress: Till now, the website have two color inputs and a text input. The color inputs will generate colors of gradient and text input defines the angle of gradient. There is also a dynamic p element which changes with the three inputs.

Target: User should be able to add as many color inputs as he wants. He should also able to define type of gradient as there are three types of gradients. You can freely help me in this project.
